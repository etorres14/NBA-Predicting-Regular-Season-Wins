As a capstone project at the California State University of Northridge, I worked with NBA datasets to create insights and statistical models, by using R studio and statistical methods. Iâ€™m huge NBA fan, so I was excited and really curious to explore the different topics I covered in my project.


This directory contains the R-code and data used to create linear regression models that were used to predict total regular NBA season wins from basic team stats. 
The R file contains code for simple linear regression as well as multiple linear regression.
